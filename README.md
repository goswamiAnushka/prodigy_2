# Advanced Stopwatch Web Application

This project is a part of the **Prodigy Infotech Internship Task**. The goal was to create a visually appealing and functional stopwatch web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project involves implementing core stopwatch functionalities such as start, stop, lap recording, and reset, along with an enhanced user interface design.

## Project Overview

The stopwatch application includes the following features:
- **Start/Stop Functionality:** Allows the user to start and pause the stopwatch.
- **Lap Recording:** Users can record lap times during the stopwatch run.
